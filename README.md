# MindWatch

Application developed for the course "Advanced User Interfaces" by Franca Garzotto at Politecnico di Milano, Computer Science and Engineering, 2015/2016.

### Description
MindWatch is a smartwatch application for brain training. The idea is to submit to the user logic, math, general-knowledge or memory questions/games at random moments of the day directly on the wearable device. The proposed games are very easy to understand and quick to solve, in accordance to the wearable device usage paradigm. The application also exploits the user current position to show location-related games, for example asking to compute the interests on a given sum if the user is at a bank.
